# Modernization plan

Inkamath was written around 2014 in the idiom of the preceding decade. It is a
small, genuinely interesting program: a lazy mathematical expression
interpreter where every identifier names an *expression* rather than a value,
with user-defined functions, complex numbers, matrices of expressions, and
sequences defined by recurrence. That design is worth keeping. The plan below
changes almost none of it — it removes the scaffolding that has rotted around
it and fixes the defects the scaffolding was hiding.

Target: **C++20**, standard library only, tested and CI-verified at every step.

Two constraints govern every phase:

- **Size.** The project's value is that it is small. No phase may make it
  larger without removing at least as much.
- **Recognisability.** The author must still recognise this as his project.
  Three ideas are his and are not up for renegotiation: names bind
  *expressions* rather than values and are re-evaluated lazily; matrices of
  expressions expand to the size of what their cells evaluate to; sequences
  are written as `f_0 = ...` and `f_n = f_(n-1) + ...`, the way mathematics
  writes a recurrence.

  This constraint used to cover the *semantics* as well. It no longer does.
  The author, reviewing the defect list below, judged the surrounding
  semantics broken — multiple bindings per identifier, implicit convergence,
  and left-hand-side evaluation — and asked for them to be redesigned rather
  than patched. Recognisability now attaches to the three ideas above and to
  the syntax that expresses them, not to the rules the 2014 interpreter
  happened to implement.

`CLAUDE.md` has the working rules.

## Verified defects — first pass

Everything in this section was reproduced against the code as it stood at the
start of this work, not inferred from reading. A second pass, after phase 6,
found more; it has its own section below.

### Build and packaging

| # | Defect |
|---|--------|
| B1 `[fixed]` | The headers could not be used from more than one translation unit. Three explicit specializations of `numeric_interface_imp<...>::parse` and a non-`inline` free function `print()` in `interpreter.hpp` produced multiple-definition link errors as soon as a second TU included them. The single-TU `main.cpp` hid this for eleven years. |
| B2 `[fixed]` | The qmake projects hardcoded `D:\boost\boost_1_55_0` and the MinGW 32-bit Boost library name `boost_unit_test_framework-mgw48-mt-d-1_55`. The project was buildable on exactly one machine, which no longer exists. |
| B3 `[fixed]` | The tests used `boost::test_toolbox::output_test_stream`, an API removed from Boost years ago, and loaded data through the hardcoded relative path `../inkamath/test/data/`. They had not compiled in a long time. |
| B4 `[fixed]` | `EvaluationVisitor` declared its constructor as `EvaluationVisitor<T>(...)`, which C++20 rejects (injected-class-name). This was the *only* thing standing between the codebase and C++20. |

### Correctness

| # | Defect |
|---|--------|
| C1 `[fixed]` | **Unbounded recursion crashes the process.** The mutually recursive arithmetic-geometric mean from the project's own test data (`am`/`gm`) overflows the stack. Confirmed under ASan. There is no evaluation depth or step budget anywhere; `Reference::SafeRecursiveEval` guards one shape of recursion and nothing guards the rest. The original test suite worked around this by running each evaluation in a thread with a 1-second timeout and calling `std::terminate()` on expiry. Fixed by a depth and step budget on `ReferenceStack` — 256 and 1000000, against a measured worst case of 33 and 6444 across every golden input. Steps as well as depth because the AGM nests shallowly but branches twice per level, so depth alone does not bound time. Those figures are stale: measured against the corpus as it stands, the deepest successful evaluation nests 36 and the longest takes 10233 steps. The budget only covers reference lookups — see C20. `f=f` was **not** an instance of this: see C16. |
| C2 `[fixed]` | **Identifiers cannot start with `i`.** `Interpreter::Lexer` routes `'i'` to `Number_Lexer` alongside the digits, so `ii=3` fails with `Syntax error`. Any name beginning with `i` is unusable, and `i` itself can never be shadowed. Fixed: `i` is the imaginary unit only when the next character cannot continue a name. No golden moved — every `i` in them is followed by an operator or a bracket. |
| C3 `[fixed]` | `ReferenceStack::WrapRecursiveExpression` never incremented its index `i` when filling `recursive_placeholders`, so every slot after the first stayed null. `EvaluationVisitor::visit(RecursiveExpression*)` then `dynamic_cast`ed each child and silently ignored the nulls — the `else` branch was an empty block with a `// TODO` in it. Recursive expressions with more than one self-reference were quietly mis-evaluated. Fixed by deleting the substitution machinery outright (phase 4 item 4). |
| C4 `[fixed]` | `ParametersCall`'s constructor contained `return; subexpr_ = subexpr;` — the assignment was unreachable. `subexpr_` was therefore never set, and the `if(subexpr_)` branch in `TryEvalIndex` was dead code; every index went through `SubVisitor`'s `a*name + b` reconstruction instead. Fixed by deleting `SubVisitor` and evaluating the index expression, which is what that dead branch had meant to do. |
| C5 `[fixed]` | **`0^0` is NaN, so `exp(0)` is NaN.** Complex `pow` is specified as `exp(b*log(a))`, and `log(0)` is `-inf`, so `std::pow(complex(0,0), complex(0,0))` is NaN — where real `std::pow(0.0, 0.0)` is `1` by IEEE 754. Every series whose first term is `x^0` is poisoned at `x == 0`. `numeric_interface_imp<std::complex<T>>` already declares a `pow(complex, int)` overload that returns `1` for this; nothing ever calls it. The sign of the NaN is unspecified, so GCC and Clang disagree — caught by the cross-compiler CI. The `nan*nan` recorded against three definitions in `sequences.ink` was this bug, not a rule about what a definition returns (that is C10). Fixed by routing an integral exponent to that unused overload; the goldens lose their last three NaNs, and the harness lost the workaround that normalised the NaN sign across compilers. |
| C10 `[fixed]` | **A definition's value is undocumented and disagrees with the README.** `EvaluationVisitor::visit(EqualExpression*)` binds the name and then returns *the left-hand side evaluated after binding*, not the right-hand side. The two are not interchangeable: the left-hand side is a **lookup**, so it can resolve to a definition other than the one just installed. `f_n=2*n` followed by `f=5` prints `60`, not `5` — lookup order is indexed, then general, then simple, so the pre-existing general term wins and its convergence loop runs to the 30-iteration cap. README §4.3 shows `0` for parameterised and general-term definitions, which is merely what the rule produces when the parameters happen to be undefined. Defining a series also runs the convergence loop immediately, with every parameter defaulted to zero. Fixed: a top-level definition is a statement handled before evaluation. It binds and echoes what was written, evaluating nothing. |
| C11 `[fixed]` | **Lookup precedence is undocumented, and a simple definition cannot shadow a general term.** A reference holds three definitions at once — singular terms (`f_0=`), a general term (`f_n=`) and a simple value (`f=`) — and `Reference::EvalImp` tries them in that order. A bare name on a sequence therefore means *the limit of the general term*, which is exactly how `exp(1)` works. It also means that once `f_n` exists, `f=5` is unreachable: bare `f` keeps iterating the series. README §4.3 states only that a singular definition beats the general term; it says nothing about the simple case. Fixed by making the two kinds mutually exclusive: an indexed clause extends a sequence, a plain definition replaces it. There is almost no precedence left to document — C26 is the exception, and it is silent. A bare sequence name and an uncovered index are now diagnostics rather than zero. |
| C12 `[fixed]` | **Asking a recurrence for its limit segfaults.** `reference.hpp:187` dereferences `memoized_index_.rbegin()` unguarded, but the enclosing condition at line 180 is `!memoized_index_.empty() \|\| !indexed_expr_.empty()` — so the body is entered with `memoized_index_` empty whenever only a singular term exists. `ReferenceStack::Eval` evaluates a *copy* of the `Reference`, so memoisation never survives and that map is in practice always empty on entry. Three lines reproduce it: `f_n=2*n`, `f_0=7`, `f`. This is the textbook way to write a recurrence — an initial value plus a general term — and asking for its limit kills the process. `exp(1)` escapes only because `exp` has no singular term. Distinct from C1: an invalid dereference, not a stack overflow. Fixed by guarding that dereference; `sequences.ink` gained the repro as a regression test. |
| C6 `[fixed]` | Parser errors printed the raw token value through `std::complex`'s stream operator: `Missing operator ']' after '(2,0)'` where the user typed `2`. Fixed by giving each token its lexeme, which also deleted `Token::Print` and its switch. |
| C7 `[fixed]` | **Failure is not expressible.** `Interpreter::Eval` wraps everything in `try`/`catch(...)`, writes the message to `std::cout`, and returns a default-constructed value. A caller cannot distinguish a successful `0` from a failure, cannot redirect the message, and cannot test error behaviour without capturing `std::cout` — which is exactly what the new test harness had to do. Fixed: `Eval` returns `std::variant<U, Echo, Diagnostic>` (`Echo` arrived with C10), the REPL formats at the edge, and `catch(...)` is gone. |
| C8 `[fixed]` | `Reference::TryEvaluateGeneralExpression` iterated a series until `diff > 1E-10 && iter_count < 30`, with both the epsilon and the cap hardcoded and neither reachable by the user, who saw only a number. They are now named constants, of which the diagnostic quotes one: `max_terms` appears in the message, `tolerance` only in the README. The cap is 100 rather than 30 so that a geometric sequence reaches the tolerance, and it cannot go much higher: each term of a recurrence nests one more reference, so the term budget is bounded by `ReferenceStack::max_depth`. Making either settable is deferred — no requirement asks for it. Its other half — a `size_t index` computed from a subtraction of `int`s, which wrapped for a negative result — went with C17. |
| C9 `[fixed]` | `numeric_interface_imp<std::complex<T>, false>` provided no `sqrt`, yet its own `abs` called `numeric_interface<T>::sqrt` — which resolved only because `T` happened to be `double`. `Matrix<T>::sqrt` threw unconditionally. The interface was only accidentally complete for the one type actually instantiated, and `zero()`/`one()` were never defined for `Matrix` at all. Fixed by deleting `sqrt` (nothing asks the value type for one; `^0.5` goes through `pow`) and by stating the rest as a `Numeric` concept, which `zero()` and `one()` are deliberately not part of. |
| C14 `[fixed]` | **Four `catch` blocks discarded errors inside a constructor.** `parameters.hpp:28, 38, 105, 115` caught `SubVisitor`/`ParametersVisitor` exceptions in the `ParametersDefinition` and `ParametersCall` constructors and returned, leaving the object half-built — `parameters_names_`, `index_name_`, `a_` and `b_` never assigned. The errors never reached `Eval`, so the phase 3 error channel did not surface them; they were invisible by construction. A sibling of C13 rather than an instance of it: there the interpreter has nothing to report, here it had something and threw it away. Fixed with C4: two of the four catches guarded `SubVisitor` and went with it, the other two are gone and `f(x=1, y)=x+y` is a golden. |
| C15 `[fixed]` | **The parser read one token past the end.** `ParseParameters` tested `Peek().type` after `ParseMatrix` had consumed the input — an `end()` dereference before the token cursor became an index, `vector::operator[](size())` after. Neither ASan nor UBSan catches it while the index lands inside the allocation, which for a vector with spare capacity is most of the time; `_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS` does, and sanitizer builds now define it. `f(1+2` is the repro and is a golden. A sweep of all 117 prefixes of ten representative inputs found no other instance — only C1. |
| C16 `[fixed]` | **`f=f` crashed on an uninitialised pointer, before recursing at all.** `RecursiveExprVisitor::to_transform_` was assigned only when descending into a child, but the constructor visits the root directly — so a self-reference at the root of a definition read an indeterminate `PExpression<T>*` and then wrote through it. The stack was ten frames deep, not overflowing; ASan does not flag a read of an uninitialised pointer, which is why this looked like C1 for several rounds. Fixed by initialising the member and not wrapping a root self-reference, which has no enclosing slot to substitute into. `f=f` and `w_n=w` are goldens and now reach the budget. |
| C17 `[fixed]` | **Indexed clauses are keyed by `size_t`, so a negative index destroys their ordering.** `reference.hpp` declares `std::map<size_t, ExpressionDefinition<T>>` while `ParametersDefinition::b()` is `int`, so `f_(-1)=0` stores at key 18446744073709551615. Lookup round-trips through the same conversion and appears to work, but `TryEvaluateGeneralExpression` picks its starting term with `indexed_expr_.rbegin()`, which then finds the negative clause as the *largest*. With `g_(-1)=0`, `g_0=5`, `g_n=g_(n-1)+1`, `g_1` is a correct `6` while bare `g` is `34`. The same signedness confusion is half of C8: `size_t index = ai_parameters.b() - gen_params_def.b()` wraps for a negative result. Matters now because an explicit base case at a negative index is exactly how the implicit zero would be written out. Fixed by keying the clause maps `long long`, which also stops the subtraction wrapping. |
| C13 `[fixed]` | **Nothing ever fails, which is why everything else survived.** An unknown identifier evaluates to `0`. Surplus arguments are dropped. A missing parameter is looked up by name in the enclosing scope — `h(x)=x^2` with `x=5` in scope makes bare `h` evaluate to `25`, which is dynamic scoping arrived at by accident. A non-integer index is truncated. None of these reports anything. The interpreter always returns a number, so a typo and a correct series are indistinguishable from the outside; that is how a decade of defects stayed invisible. Root cause of the plausibility of C1, C2, C5, C10 and C11 alike. Arity, the undefined name and the truncated index are all diagnostics now, and the dynamic-scoping half went with phase 4 item 5 — but the class is not closed: C25, C26, C27, C29 and C30 are the same shape, found by the second pass. |

### Design and dead weight

| # | Defect |
|---|--------|
| D1 `[fixed]` | `template <typename T> using PExpression = std::shared_ptr<Expression<T>>` is written out identically in six headers. |
| D2 `[fixed]` | `sequence.hpp` is included by nothing. `pmath.hpp`/`pmath.cpp` define a `fact()` that nothing calls — superseded by `numeric_interface<T>::fact`, which is a verbatim copy of it. `main.cpp` carries a dead `inkamath_test()` function that duplicates the test data. |
| D3 `[fixed]` | `interpreter.hpp` includes `expression_visitor.hpp` *in the middle of the file*, after the class definition, to break a circular dependency. `make_matrix_array_from_vector` is called four lines before it is declared and resolves only through ADL at instantiation. |
| D4 `[fixed]` | `Matrix<T>` owned a raw `T*` with `new[]`/`delete[]`, copied it with `memcpy` (undefined for any `T` that is not trivially copyable), had no move constructor or move assignment, and exposed `Matrix(const T&)` as an implicit converting constructor. Its `std::vector` constructor could leak on exception and carried the author's own note: `// todo : reimplement this matrix class...`. Rewritten on `std::vector<T>` with the rule of zero, explicit constructors and an `Extent` for the dimensions. 385 lines become 184, plus a 19-line header; every golden is byte-identical, and so is a sweep of twenty matrix operations and errors — a sweep which, as C22 and C23 show, contained no matrix wider than two and no exponent above two. |
| D5 `[fixed]` | `dynarray` was a hand-rolled container written while waiting for a `std::dynarray` that C++14 never shipped. `std::vector` covered every use here, and value-initialises where `new T[n]` left `size_t` elements indeterminate. |
| D6 `[fixed]` | `Expression` exposed `children` as a public mutable member while subclasses also offered `m_e1()`/`m_e()` accessors over the same storage, with mutable overloads of their own. `children_` is private now, reachable through a const `Children()` for the generic case and the named views for the rest, and none of them can write: the tree is immutable once parsed. `Clone()` deep-copied subtrees that `shared_ptr` already lets us share — its last caller was the recursion machinery phase 4 deleted, so it went too, along with `transform_visitation`. |
| D7 `[not a defect any more]` | `ExpressionVisitor` had eleven pure virtual `visit` overloads plus two that defaulted to returning `{}` — the recursive nodes. Those two went with the machinery in phase 4, so every overload is pure virtual and forgetting one is a compile error in both visitors, not a silent mistake. What remains is that adding a node type touches two visitors, which is the check working. |
| D8 `[fixed]` | Reserved identifiers: `_EXPRESION_EPSILON` (misspelled, and unused) and `_NUMERIC_INTERFACE_PRECISION`. A leading underscore followed by a capital is reserved to the implementation. |
| D9 `[fixed, differently]` | `Interpreter<T, U = Matrix<T>>` templates on the token scalar `T`, but every AST node is instantiated on `U`. Every literal in every expression was therefore a heap-allocated 1×1 `Matrix<complex<double>>`. Measured: those 16-byte allocations are 44–67% of all allocations, but removing them is worth only 0–15% of the time — they are cheap and hot in cache. A 1x1 matrix now keeps its cell inline, which gets that saving for ten lines; the scalar/matrix *split* the plan prescribed is not justified by the numbers. |
| D10 `[fixed]` | `getlines.hpp` reimplements line iteration on top of `std::iterator`, deprecated since C++17. Its only user was the Boost test file. |
| D11 (partly fixed) | Comments and commit history are in French, the README was half French and half English, and the public documentation described behaviour the code does not have — not only C5 but the implicit limit, the dynamic scoping and the three kinds of definition, all of which phase 4 removed. The README is rewritten in English and is now executable, so that half cannot recur. The 2014 comments in the sources are still French. |

## Verified defects — second pass

Found after phase 6, by a review that ran the interpreter rather than reading
it. Every entry was reproduced at `3fedbcd`; the input shown is the whole
repro. Most predate the modernization and survived it because nothing
exercised them — the golden corpus never built a matrix larger than 2x2, never
raised one to a power, and never typed a line that was only a comment. Three
are the modernization's own: C18 is a regression, C20 and C29 are claims it
made that are not true.

### Crashes

| # | Defect |
|---|--------|
| C18 `[fixed]` | **A comment-only line kills the process.** `# hello` segfaults. `Lexer`'s `case '#': return;` leaves before its own `if (m_tokens.empty()) Fail("empty expression")` guard, and `Eval` then reads `m_tokens[0].type == Query`. A **regression**, introduced with `?` in `e53a564`; the same input printed `0` at its parent. `basics.ink` tests a trailing comment and never a line that is only one. Fixed by making `#` skip to the end of the line rather than leave the function, so a comment-only line reaches the same `empty expression` diagnostic as a blank one. |
| C19 `[fixed]` | **An empty matrix kills the process.** `[]`, `[ ]`, `[;]` and `[]+1` segfault. `ParseMatrix` accepted zero elements and built an n×0 `MatExpression`; `EvaluationVisitor::visit(MatExpression*)` then called `rj_cols.back()` on an empty vector. Fixed in the parser: a matrix with no elements has no extent to give. `[1;]` still pads to `1 0`, which is a row that is merely short. |
| C20 `[fixed]` | **The evaluation budget covers reference lookups and nothing else.** Both the recursive-descent parser and the AST fold are unbounded C++ recursion: `(` ×8000 segfaults while parsing (4000 is fine), and a flat `1+1+…` of 50000 terms segfaults while folding. `README.md` §6 claimed "a runaway recursion is reported rather than crashing the process" and C1 read as though the whole class was closed; both were true only of recursion through a name. Fixed with a limit on the token count of one line, which bounds every recursion a line can provoke — the parser's, the evaluator's and the destructor's — since the tree has at most one node per token. 1000, against a measured overflow at about 2000 nested parentheses under the sanitizer and about 8000 without it. A crude bound, but one check covers the class, where a parser depth limit would leave the flat case building a tree too deep to destroy. |
| C21 `[fixed]` | **The REPL never exits on end of input.** `printf '1+1\n' | ./build/inkamath` loops forever: `getline` fails, `s` stays empty, and `error: empty expression` is printed until the process is killed. `src/main.cpp` checked `s=="q"` and never `cin`'s state. Fixed by breaking on a failed `getline`. A regression here hangs rather than fails, so the test is a `ctest` entry with a timeout — the first coverage the REPL loop has ever had. |

### Wrong answers

| # | Defect |
|---|--------|
| C22 `[fixed]` | **A matrix with three or more rows or columns cannot be built.** `[1 2 3]`, `[1;2;3]`, `[1 2 3;4 5 6]` and `[pi, e, 1]` all give `error: Out of matrix range.` In `EvaluationVisitor::visit(MatExpression*)` the block-offset prefix sum is `rj_cols[j] += j_cols[j-1]`, reading the unmodified source array, so it yields `{w0, w0+w1, w1+w2}` instead of a running total; `rm` is then too small and the result is allocated undersized. Correct for two blocks, which was every size the corpus and the README used. Fixed by writing the prefix sum plainly — it is shorter than the rotate-and-zero it replaces — and the corpus gains matrices three blocks wide and three tall, plus a cell extended to fill its block. |
| C23 `[fixed]` | **Matrix exponentiation computes the wrong power.** `Matrix::pow` does `r = a; for(i = 1; i < n; ++i) r = r*r;` — squaring the accumulator, so `a^n` is `a^(2^(n-1))`. With `a=[1 1;0 1]`: `a^2` is right by luck (one iteration), `a^3` gives `a^4`, `a^4` gives `a^8`. `a^0`, `a^0.5` and a negative exponent all returned `a` unchanged, with no diagnostic. Fixed: the accumulator starts at the identity and is multiplied by `a` once per power, and the three cases that have no answer — a fractional exponent, a negative one, and a matrix that is not square — say so. That also bounds the loop, since the exponent is now the iteration count rather than a doubling. |
| C24 `[fixed]` | **The interpreter gives different answers on GCC and Clang.** `a=1` then `g=(a=a+1)+a` then `g` prints `3` under GCC and `4` under Clang. Every binary node evaluates `m_e1()->accept(*this) OP m_e2()->accept(*this)`, and C++ does not order the operands, so any expression containing a definition is compiler-dependent. Both builds passed `ctest`. Fixed at the root rather than by removing what observes it: `EvaluationVisitor`'s binary nodes now sequence their operands left to right. `aaa+bbb` is the regression test, which needs no side effect at all — it reported `bbb` under GCC and `aaa` under Clang. Left to right is also the order phase 8 needs, so this is its prerequisite rather than a workaround for C29. |
| C25 `[fixed]` | **A keyword argument is never checked against the parameter names.** `CheckArity` counts arguments and never compares names, so `f(x)=x+1` called as `f(y=1)` passes, leaves `x` unbound, and lets it fall through to a global: with `x=99` in scope the answer is `100`. A duplicate is accepted the same way — `g(x,y)=x*10+y` called as `g(1,x=2)` discards the positional argument and answers `27`. Fixed by checking names rather than only counting: an unknown keyword, a keyword that repeats a positional argument, and a keyword that fills an optional parameter while leaving a required one empty (`k(a,b=5)` called as `k(b=2)`) each say so. That last case the count alone could never have caught. |
| C26 `[fixed]` | **An index on a plain definition is discarded in silence.** `m=5` then `m_3` prints `5`; so does `m_(-2)`, and `pi_7` prints `3.14159265`. `EvalImp` returns the plain clause before it ever looks at whether an index was supplied. `?m_3` on the same definition *does* report `m has no clause for index 3`, so the two paths disagree. The last survivor of the class C13 set out to end, and `references.ink:98` recorded it without saying so. Fixed in both paths, which now give the same message; the golden moved and says what it is testing. |
| C27 `[fixed]` | **`lim` reports a limit for sequences that have none.** `Converge` seeds `previous` with a default-constructed `T`, then compares the first real term against that fabricated zero, so `u_n=n-1` — which diverges — gives `lim u` = `0`. The same seed breaks a matrix-valued sequence with an unrelated message, since the first subtraction is 2x2 minus 1x1. Separately, the stopping test `!(diff > tolerance)` is true for NaN, so `w_0=2; w_n=w_(n-1)^2; lim w` answers `inf*-nan` instead of reporting non-convergence. Fixed: with no base clause the first term is not compared to anything, and the test is `<= tolerance` so that NaN counts as not converged. What remains is inherent to an absolute tolerance rather than a defect — `v_n=n/100000000000` still reports `2e-11`, because consecutive terms really do agree to 1e-10; `lim` reports the first term within tolerance of its predecessor, which is what the README says it does. |
| C28 | **An out-of-range exponent is converted to `int` unchecked.** The C5 fix routes any exponent with `imag()==0 && real()==floor(real())` through `static_cast<int>(b.real())`. `2^2147483648` gives `0` and `0.5^3000000000` gives `inf*-nan` — undefined behaviour, and silently wrong either way. GCC's `-fsanitize=undefined` does not include `float-cast-overflow`, so the sanitizer job does not see it; adding that check to `INKAMATH_SANITIZE` would. |
| C29 | **A definition that is not at the root still evaluates its left-hand side.** `Interpreter::Eval` handles a definition as a statement only when it is the whole input; anywhere else `EvaluationVisitor::visit(EqualExpression*)` binds and then returns `m_e1()->accept(*this)`, which is the C10 mechanism. So `1+(b=3)` is `4`, `0+(h(x)=x^2)` is `error: x is not defined`, and `0+(p=p)` exhausts the depth budget. A definition's index is evaluated at bind time too: `g_(1+zzz)=5` reports `zzz is not defined` and binds nothing. C10's own entry is worded correctly — "a **top-level** definition is a statement" — but phase 4 item 3 and `README.md` §3 drop the qualifier and so claim more than is true. **Decision: a definition nested in an expression becomes a syntax error**, as a step towards phase 8 rather than as a verdict on the idea. The construct was meant to bind a local reusable later in the same expression — the 2014 README says so: "L'assignation étant une expression comme une autre, on peut trouver une assignation aussi bien dans la liste des paramètres d'une référence ou dans la partie droite d'une autre assignation." Measured, it never delivered that. It was compiler-dependent — `(t=3)+t` was `6` under Clang and `t is not defined` under GCC — until C24 fixed the order, and it is now `6` on both; that removed the strongest argument for the error, since C24 no longer depends on it. What remains: since phase 4 item 5 a local cannot see the parameters it exists to capture — `f(x)=(t=2*x)+t` then `f(5)` reports `x is not defined`, because `t` holds `2*x` and is evaluated in a frame that sees only globals. At the top level the binding is not local either: `(t=3)+t` leaves `t` defined as `3`. Phase 8's prototype fixes both without an error, so the decision stands only as a stepping stone and should be revisited against that phase rather than taken as settled. The error costs one function body — `EvaluationVisitor::visit(EqualExpression*)` becomes a throw — and removes nothing phase 8 would reuse, since that body gets the scope, the timing and the value semantics all wrong. `EqualExpression` itself stays: the parser, the statement path in `Eval`, and `ParametersVisitor`'s keyword arguments are its other three users. `(a=2)` alone keeps working, because parentheses build no node and the root is still a definition. |
| C30 `[fixed]` | **Default arguments are evaluated when they are not used, and in the wrong scope.** `f(x,y=zzz)=x` then `f(1,2)` reports `zzz is not defined`, although `y` was supplied and `zzz` is never needed: `SetCallParameters` evaluates every entry of `parameters_dict_` before the positional ones. They also resolve in the *caller's* scope, so `x=100` then `f(x,y=2*x)=y` then `f(5)` gives `200` rather than `10` — against `README.md` §3, which says a name inside a definition resolves to that definition's own parameters first. Fixed by binding defaults after the supplied arguments rather than before: only a parameter the call left empty gets one, and it is evaluated in the callee's frame, where the definition's other parameters are visible. |
| C31 | **A NaN imaginary part prints as malformed output.** `numeric_interface_imp<std::complex<T>>::toString` tests `imag > 0` and `imag < 0`, both false for NaN, so no `i` is emitted — but the following `imag != 1 && imag != -1 && imag != 0` is true, so it appends `"*" + toString(imag)`. `1/0` prints `inf*-nan` and `0/0` prints `-nan*-nan`, neither of which the lexer can read back. Everything else in that function is correct, including negative zero and infinities. |

### Cost

| # | Defect |
|---|--------|
| C32 | **Parsing a nested call is exponential.** `ParseEqualExpr` speculatively parses name, parameters and subscript for any `Parse()` beginning with an identifier, then on finding no `=` rewinds and parses the same text again; nesting multiplies. `f(f(f(…1…)))` takes 0.04s at depth 16, 0.59s at 20, 2.34s at 22 and 9.34s at 24 — a factor of four every two levels. Depth 40 is a 121-character line that does not finish in a minute. The cursor restore itself is correct on every path; the defect is cost. Parenthesis nesting alone is unaffected, and so is `f(1*f(1*…`, which never enters the speculative path. |

### Design and documentation

| # | Defect |
|---|--------|
| D12 | **The `Numeric` and `Parsable` concepts do not state what they claim to.** `Numeric` omits five things `Interpreter` requires of `U` — `value_type`, construction from the token scalar, `Size()`, construction from `Extent`, and `operator()(size_t,size_t)` — so a type can satisfy it in full and still fail to compile. `Parsable` rejects nothing at all: a *declaration* satisfies a `requires` expression, so `Parsable<int>` is true and the failure is still only the link error that existed before the concept. Both were added in `3b12778`, whose message claims more than they deliver. |
| D13 | **`Matrix`'s diagnostics are in a second voice.** `Out of matrix range.`, `Incompatible dimensions in matrix operation.`, `Fact is not implemented for Matrix type.` and `Incompatible dimension in matrix assigmentation. Conversion` are capitalized, punctuated, newline-terminated and in one case misspelled, against `interpreter.hpp`'s own rule that messages are lower case, unpunctuated and quote what the user typed. All are reachable from a one-line input. Part of D11's remainder, and larger than that entry admits. |
| D14 | **Comments cite README sections that phase 6 deleted.** `references.ink:1` and `:15`, `sequences.ink:1`, `errors.ink:57`, `matrices.ink:1`, and `parameters.hpp:14` and `:28` all cite the old French numbering (§3 Matrices, §4.1/4.2/4.3 references). `errors.ink:57` goes further and attributes to the README a statement it no longer contains. `sequences.ink:46` cites C4 for the implicit zero, which is phase 4 item 4. The `readme` test replays fenced blocks and so catches none of this. |
| D15 | **`CLAUDE.md` promises a list that does not exist.** §3 says some recorded outputs are deliberately wrong and "are listed in `MODERNIZATION.md`". The only list there was phase 0's, naming C5 and C6; both are fixed and both goldens have moved. `references.ink:98` (C26) is the first entry a restored list would need. |
| D16 | **Two smaller ones.** `numeric_interface_imp<std::complex<T>>::one()` returns `(1,1)` rather than `(1,0)`; latent, since nothing instantiates it. `reference_stack.hpp`'s `friend struct Frame;` declares a namespace-scope `::Frame` as a friend, not the nested `Frame` on the next line, which needs no friendship at all. |

### What the review confirmed

Worth recording, so it is not re-derived. The historical claims in the first
pass are accurate: the 2014 baseline was rebuilt and the *old* behaviour
reproduced for C1, C2, C5, C6, C10, C12, C13, C14 and C16 before confirming
each is gone. Goldens re-record byte-identically. `-Werror` is clean on GCC
and Clang and `ctest` is green on all three configurations. The three items
marked as deliberately not implemented as written — D9's mechanism, half of
C9, and D7 — match the code as it stands, and phase 4 item 2's measurement
reproduces: `max_terms = 200` leaves `lim exp(1)-e` at `-7.69606601e-13`.

The copy-on-write definition store has no lifetime or aliasing hazard under
sixty sanitizer fuzz runs; frame push and pop are balanced and exception-safe;
the `size_t` underflow in `CheckArity` is unreachable by construction; and
outside C18 there is no out-of-bounds token read, checked by running every
prefix of a 35-input corpus and twelve thousand random lines under the
sanitizer build.

---

## Phase 0 — Make it buildable and verifiable `[done]`

Nothing else can be trusted until a change can be checked. This phase changed
no interpreter behaviour; the transcripts recorded in it are the baseline every
later phase is measured against.

- CMake ≥ 3.20 replacing the two qmake projects. Targets: `inkamath` (the
  library), `inkamath_cli` (the REPL), `inkamath_tests`.
- C++20, `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`, opt-in `-Werror` and sanitizers.
- Boost.Test replaced by vendored doctest (`third_party/doctest`, header-only).
  `mapstack_test` and `dynarray_test` ported mechanically.
- New golden-transcript harness (`test/transcript.hpp`): `.ink` files are
  literal interpreter sessions, one interpreter per file, capturing both the
  result and whatever the interpreter wrote to `std::cout`. Regenerate with
  `cmake --build build --target record_goldens`.
- Five transcripts drawn from `README.md`: `basics`, `matrices`, `references`,
  `sequences`, `errors`.
- GitHub Actions: GCC and Clang × Debug and RelWithDebInfo with `-Werror`,
  an ASan+UBSan job, and a clang-format check limited to changed lines.
- Fixed B1–B4 and the four warnings that stood in the way of `-Werror`
  (two `std::bind2nd` uses removed in C++17 by libc++ and deprecated
  everywhere; `EqualExpression::Name() const` silently *hiding* rather than
  overriding `Expression::Name()`, so the override was reachable only through
  a statically-typed `EqualExpression*`).

The goldens record current behaviour **including its bugs** — C5 and C6 are
visible in `sequences.ink` and `errors.ink`. That is deliberate: a bug that is
pinned by a test cannot regress unnoticed, and the diff when it is fixed is the
proof that it was fixed.

## Phase 1 — Clear the ground `[done]`

No behaviour change. Every `.ink` file came out byte-identical, which was the
acceptance criterion for the whole phase.

1. Delete `sequence.hpp`, `pmath.hpp`, `pmath.cpp`, and `inkamath_test()` from
   `main.cpp` (D2). `inkamath` becomes a header-only `INTERFACE` target.
2. Hoist `PExpression` into a single header and delete the other five
   definitions (D1).
3. Fix the include graph: forward-declaration header for the visitors, so
   `interpreter.hpp` can include `expression_visitor.hpp` at the top like a
   normal file; declare `make_matrix_array_from_vector` before use (D3).
4. Rename `_EXPRESION_EPSILON` and `_NUMERIC_INTERFACE_PRECISION`; the first is
   unused and should simply go (D8).
5. `override` on every override, `= default`/`= delete` on special members.
6. Move to a conventional layout — `include/inkamath/`, `src/`, `test/` — as
   its own commit, containing nothing but the moves.
7. Delete `getlines.hpp` (D10); nothing uses it any more.

## Phase 2 — Write the language down `[done]`

The redesign was specified as transcripts before it was implemented, in
`test/data/spec/*.ink`. They used the phase 0 harness, so the specification
was executable: running them printed a diff between the language we had and
the language we wanted. They were registered under a `spec` doctest suite and
marked `may_fail`, so they reported without gating CI, and `record_goldens`
never rewrote them — recording a specification from current behaviour would
have defeated its purpose. The gap closed from 36 failing assertions to none
over phases 3 and 4.

As each part of the design landed, its entries moved into `test/data/` and
became ordinary goldens. With phase 4 complete the directory and the suite
are gone; reinstate both if a later phase designs rather than repairs.

This ordering is deliberate. The README and the code disagree today (C5, C10,
C11) because the prose was written once and then drifted. A specification that
is run on every push cannot drift.

## Phase 3 — Failure exists `[done]`

C13 first, because everything else is easier to see once the interpreter stops
answering every question with a number.

1. **An error channel** (C7) `[done]`. `Eval` returns a `std::variant`
   instead of printing to `std::cout` and returning a default-constructed
   value. The REPL prints at the edge, where it belongs;
   the test harness stopped hijacking `std::cout`. `std::expected` would be
   the natural type and is C++23, so this becomes one mechanically if the
   project ever moves.
2. **Diagnostics quote the text the user typed** (C6) `[done]`, and the token
   rework that enables it: `std::vector<Token>` with an index in place of
   `std::list` with a member iterator, so the parser's backtracking is visible
   rather than incidental.

   Two parts of this item were dropped after looking at the code. A
   `std::variant` payload is unnecessary: once a token carries its lexeme,
   `name` *is* the lexeme, `Print()` is `return text;`, and the whole switch
   goes — smaller than a variant and it fixes C6 outright. Source *positions*
   are not needed either: nothing renders one. The diagnostics quote the
   offending token rather than pointing at a column, which reads better for
   single-line input, and inkamath has no other kind. Adding `offset` to
   `Token` is three lines whenever something wants a caret.
3. **Arity mismatch becomes a diagnostic** (C13) `[done]`. The check sits at
   the user's call, not at every parameter binding: the recursion machinery
   builds synthetic `ParametersCall`s carrying no arguments on purpose, and
   checking those breaks `exp(1)`.

   The other two thirds of this item are **blocked on phase 4**, which is not
   what the plan assumed. Both were tried and reverted:

   - **Unknown name** `[done]`. Was blocked on C10: reporting an undefined
     name broke *defining* a function, because a definition evaluated its own
     left-hand side with its parameters unbound. Unblocked the moment
     definitions became statements, and landed with four goldens moving from
     a silent `0` to a diagnostic.
   - **Non-integer index.** A throw from `SubVisitor` never reaches the user:
     the `ParametersDefinition` and `ParametersCall` constructors catch it and
     `return` (C14). Verified with a probe that threw unconditionally and
     changed nothing an interpreter session could see. Those catches are
     load-bearing — they are how the code decides an expression is not an
     index — so they cannot simply be deleted; the clause model in phase 4
     replaces them.
4. **Evaluation budget** (C1) `[done]`. A per-`Eval` limit on recursion depth
   and total steps, reported as a diagnostic. The arithmetic-geometric mean
   runs instead of dying, and a sweep of all 117 prefixes of ten representative
   inputs now runs clean under ASan, UBSan and `_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS` — it
   previously overflowed the stack.
5. **Fix the `i` lexing rule** (C2) `[done]`.
6. **`0^0`** (C5) `[done]`. Moved exactly the three predicted lines and left
   `exp(1)-e` unchanged, as forecast when the fix was first measured.

## Phase 4 — The definition model `[done]`

The redesign proper. Replaces C10 and C11 rather than deciding them.

1. **One definition per name** `[done]`. `Reference`'s three parallel slots
   (`single_expr_`, `indexed_expr_`, `general_expr_`) collapse into one
   definition that may have several *clauses*: constant-index base cases plus
   at most one general clause. `f_0 = 1` and `f_n = f_(n-1)/2` are two clauses
   of one sequence, the way a recurrence is written on paper. A later `f = 5`
   *replaces* the definition instead of hiding underneath it, and the
   undocumented indexed/general/simple precedence disappears with the slots.
2. **No implicit limit** `[done]`. A bare name never means "iterate until it
   stops changing"; `lim` is a reserved word taking a sequence name, and a
   bare sequence name is a diagnostic that names both ways out. Non-
   convergence is reported with the budget and the last term rather than
   silently returning the term the loop stopped on, so `lim k` on a divergent
   recurrence says so where bare `k` used to answer `35`. `exp(1)-e` is
   `-7.7e-13` not from floating point but from a series stopped as soon as
   two terms agree to 1e-10 — measured, not the 30-term cap this item
   originally blamed: raising the cap to 200 leaves the figure unchanged.
   The justification given for choosing 100 — that a recurrence nests one
   reference per term against a depth budget of 256, so it could not go much
   higher — is wrong. Measured, a recurrence reaches index 254, so there are
   some 150 terms of headroom, and the cap is what bites a legitimate input:
   `cos(40)`, built from the README's own definitions, reports
   `exp did not converge within 100 terms`. See also C27.
3. **A definition is a statement** `[done]` at the top level, and **only**
   there — see C29, which is this item's unfinished half. It binds and echoes
   what it bound; it evaluates nothing. No left-hand-side lookup, no right-hand-side evaluation,
   no convergence loop triggered by typing a definition.
4. **A recurrence needs its base case; there is no implicit value at an
   undefined index** `[done]`. `SafeRecursiveEval` returned `0` below the
   lowest defined index, an unannounced choice of the *additive* identity.
   It is right for a series and wrong for a product: `p_n = p_(n-1)*n` with no
   base evaluates to `0` at every index, while `p_0 = 1` gives `1, 2, 6, 24,
   120`. The 2014 test data makes the point by itself — `exp`, `ln` and `atan`
   are additive and carry no base, the arithmetic-geometric mean is
   multiplicative and carries `am(x,y)_0` and `gm(x,y)_0`. Base cases were
   already written wherever the hidden zero would have been wrong. Done by
   deleting `WrapRecursiveExpression`, `SafeRecursiveEval`,
   `RecursiveExprVisitor` and the two recursive expression nodes: an indexed
   call is now evaluated at the index it asks for, against the clause that
   covers it. `sequences.ink` gained `exp(x)_0=1`, which the hidden zero had
   been supplying, and `fact_n=fact_(n-1)*n` as the case it got wrong. C3 and
   C16 go with the machinery.
5. **Parameters are lexically scoped** (C13) `[done]`. A missing argument is a
   diagnostic, not a search of the enclosing scope for a name that matches.
   A name resolves in the innermost call's parameters and then in the global
   scope, and nowhere else. `Mapstack` went with the change: it copied every
   live name forward on `Push`, which is what made a caller's parameters
   visible to everything it called. Two plain maps replace it.
6. **`?name` prints a definition back** `[done]`, as written, without
   evaluating it. On a sequence it prints every clause, so the whole definition is visible
   at once — which the three parallel slots made impossible. Together with
   item 3 this is what makes the core idea legible: after `b = a+a` and
   `a = 2`, `?b` is `b = a+a` while `b` is `4`. Each clause stores the line
   that bound it, so `?` quotes what was typed rather than rendering the
   parsed expression; there is no pretty-printer to disagree with the parser.
7. C3, C4, C14 and C17 were small bugs in machinery this phase rewrote; they
   went away with it rather than being patched first.

## Phase 5 — Value types and the core `[done]`

1. Rewrite `Matrix<T>` (D4) `[done]`: `std::vector<T>` storage, rule of zero,
   explicit constructors, dimensions as one `Extent` type. The author asked
   for this in a comment in 2014. `Extent` also replaces the
   `std::pair<size_t,size_t>` that `Expression::Size` returned, so rows and
   columns can no longer be swapped by a `std::tie` in the wrong order.
   Making the converting constructor explicit turned D9 from a claim into a
   compile error: the one place that relied on it is the literal in
   `ParseSimpleExpr`, which is exactly the per-literal 1x1 allocation item 3
   is about.
2. Delete `dynarray` (D5) in favour of `std::vector`, and delete its test
   `[done]`. 192 lines of container plus 140 of test, for six uses.
3. Stop allocating a 1x1 matrix per literal (D9) `[done, not as written]`.
   Measured first, as the item asked. The allocation is real — 44–67% of all
   allocations across five workloads — but it is *not* the largest single win:
   removing it is worth 0–15% of the time, and nothing at all on the series
   case. `Matrix` now holds a 1x1 cell inline, which buys that for ten lines
   and no change to any caller.

   Separating the types, as this item prescribed, would need a `variant`
   value, four-way dispatch on every operator and two `numeric_interface`
   instantiations, for the same 0–15%. It is ruled out on the size constraint.

   The measurement found the larger win elsewhere: `ReferenceStack::Eval`
   copied the whole `Reference` on every lookup — maps, strings and parameter
   lists — to protect against the name being redefined while its own body
   ran. Definitions are now shared and copied on write, which is both cheaper
   and stronger: the hazard is structurally impossible rather than defended
   against. Worth 24–30% on every recursion-heavy workload. Together the two
   changes are 17% to 33% across the five, and the agm goes from 708ms to
   507ms for 200 evaluations of `gm(1,2)_10`.
4. Replace `numeric_interface`/`best_promotion`/`numeric_interface_imp_types`
   with C++20 concepts (C9) `[done, partly]`. `best_promotion` and
   `numeric_interface_imp_types` are deleted outright: the first served a
   generic `parse` that nothing ever reached, the second declared return
   types that `auto` deduces. `sqrt` is deleted with them.

   `numeric_interface` itself stays. It is not an abstraction to replace but
   the dispatch between "the type has static members" and "the type is a
   builtin", and a concept does not do that job — replacing it would mean
   writing `pow`, `fact`, `abs` and `toString` as free functions for `double`,
   `complex` and `Matrix`, which is more code for the same behaviour. What the
   concepts do is state the requirement: `Interpreter` is declared
   `template <Parsable T, Numeric U>`, so a type missing an operation fails at
   the declaration, naming it.
5. Make `Expression::children` private with a narrow accessor (D6) `[done]`.
   The redundant view this dropped is the raw one, not `m_e1()`/`m_e()` as
   written here: the named views are what thirty call sites read and are the
   clearer of the two, while `children[0]->children[1]` in `Bind` was the
   unreadable half. What made the two views a hazard was that both were
   mutable; neither is now.
6. Collapse the visitor interface (D7) `[dropped]`. The item rested on two
   `visit` overloads that defaulted to returning `{}`, and those were deleted
   in phase 4 along with the nodes they served. Its own complaint — forgetting
   an overload is silent — is now false: all eleven are pure virtual, so a new
   node type is a compile error in both visitors. Adding the prescribed
   default would *reintroduce* that silence.

   The mechanism is also wrong for both visitors this project has. Recursing
   over `children` has no meaning for a fold returning one `T` — which child's
   value would it be? — and `ParametersVisitor`'s correct default is to record
   the whole subtree as one argument, which is the opposite of descending into
   it. Its eight identical one-line overrides are the price of the check, and
   at two visitors that is cheap.

   What did go is `StatefulVisitor`: an empty class over `TransformationVisitor`
   whose ten-line comment warned that nothing stopped a visitor modifying the
   AST in secret. After D6 nothing can.

   The `std::variant` + `std::visit` alternative would delete the
   `accept`/`visit` double dispatch outright and is the more modern design, but
   the double dispatch is a choice the author documented in
   `expression_visitor.hpp`. Ruled out on recognisability, not on the merits.

## Phase 6 — Documentation `[done]`

1. `README.md` in English, matching actual behaviour `[done]`. Its examples
   are not merely drawn from the transcripts: every fenced block in the file
   is replayed as one session by the `readme` test, so the documentation
   cannot drift without failing CI. Writing it that way found three
   statements that were wrong — sections that quietly assumed a fresh
   interpreter.
2. Keep the French history — it is the project's provenance — but write new
   comments in English (D11) `[done]` for the README; the 2014 comments in
   the sources are still French and are rewritten as their code is.
3. A short note on the interpreter's model `[done]`: references name
   expressions, not values. It was explained halfway down section 4; it is now
   the first thing the README says, with the example that makes it concrete.

## Phase 7 — What the review found

Ordered by what a user hits first, not by where the defect lives.

1. **Nothing kills the process** `[done]`: C18, C19, C21, C20 — and C24,
   which belonged here once it was clear that sequencing the binary operands
   left to right costs five lines and is what phase 8 needs anyway. That
   removed the argument for doing C29 early; see the note under phase 8.
2. **Matrices work** `[done]`: C22 and C23. The corpus gained matrices three
   blocks wide and three tall, a cell extended to fill its block, and `^` on a
   matrix at all. `Matrix` also gains the unit test it never had: `CLAUDE.md`
   §4 reserves those for containers, and after `dynarray` and `Mapstack` went
   there were none left, which is how both of these survived eleven years.
   Verified against the defect rather than assumed — restoring the squaring
   loop fails six of its assertions.
3. **No answer to a question nobody asked** `[done]`: C26, C25, C27, C30.
   This was C13's unfinished business; C29 is the same shape but was taken
   out of this group — see the note under phase 8.
4. **The rest**: C28, C31, C32, then D12 to D16.

Coverage the corpus does not have today, beyond the repros above: a matrix
larger than 2x2 in any operation; `^` on a matrix; the step-budget message,
which is reachable but never tested; `lim` on a plain definition, on nothing,
and on a term; default parameter values, which work and are undocumented; a
two-base-case recurrence such as Fibonacci, which is the exact shape C3 was
about; `2i`, `1e3`, `0x10` and `.5` in the lexer; and shadowing a built-in
with `pi=3`.


## Phase 8 — Names bind expressions, everywhere

Locals and parameters, which turned out to be one change. The 2014 README
lists "Évaluation paresseuse (en: lazy-evaluation)" first among the project's
features; parameters bind values, evaluated once in the caller's scope, which
is the opposite. `f(x)=1` called as `f(undefined)` reports `undefined is not
defined` for an argument it never reads. So this phase is not adding an idea
but finishing one.

Specified as transcripts before it is implemented, the way phase 2 did it.

### One rule

Prototyped and measured, not sketched:

> A definition is evaluated at the depth where it was written. A frame exists
> only to hold bindings.

`ReferenceStack` gains a lookup depth; a definition records the depth it was
written at, and evaluating it restores that depth. A frame is pushed only when
there is something to bind. `Bind` installs the argument *expression* with the
caller's depth rather than a value.

That one rule gives all three things the old form got wrong. Measured on the
prototype, with **every golden byte-identical**:

| | |
|---|--------|
| `f2(x)=1` then `f2(undefined)` | `1` — the unused argument is never evaluated |
| `f(x)=(t=2*x)+t` then `f(5)` | `20` — a local captures the parameter |
| `g(x)=(u=x*x)+(v=u+1)+v` then `g(3)` | `29` — locals chain |
| `t` afterwards | `t is not defined` — no leak |
| `q=y+1`, `r(y)=q`, `r(2)` | `y is not defined` — lexical scoping intact |

It replaces the frames-plus-globals special case rather than layering on it,
so it is a simplification, not an addition. C24 is its prerequisite and is
already done: without a defined operand order there is no "before" for a local
to be bound in.

### The cost, measured

Call-by-name re-evaluates an argument on every read, and each read walks the
chain of argument expressions down the call stack, so passing `x` through *n*
levels makes reading it O(n) instead of O(1). On the arithmetic-geometric
mean, which passes two arguments down a doubling recursion:

| | eager | lazy |
|---|---|---|
| `gm(1,2)_10` … `_14` | correct | correct, about 37% more time |
| `gm(1,2)_15` | `1.45679103` | `error: evaluation gave up after 1000000 steps` |

Allocations *fall* by 21%, so this is re-evaluation and nothing else. Four of
the five benchmark workloads are unchanged; the agm is the whole cost.

A caution for whoever measures this next: a lazy build appears *faster* than
an eager one at `gm(1,2)_16`, because it is hitting the step budget and
stopping early. Compare answers before comparing times.

### The open question

**Call-by-name or call-by-need.** Memoising each argument would recover the
agm, and is what makes laziness practical in every language that has it. It
means reintroducing a cache in a language where names rebind, which is the
hard part: `a=1`, `b=a+a`, `a=2`, `b` is `4` precisely because nothing is
cached. A thunk memoised for the duration of one call is probably sound, since
no binding it reads can change within that call, but that needs proving rather
than assuming. The step budget should be revisited with it — it becomes the
limit users meet.

### The smaller ones

- **Syntax.** `(t = 2*x) + t` is what the 2014 design used and what the
  prototype accepts. If C29 lands first, the form it rejects and the form this
  phase accepts must differ, or the error is meaningless — which is an argument
  for making the nested definition a *local* rather than an error.
- **Extent.** Does a local live to the end of the expression or the end of the
  line? At the top level the prototype still binds a global, because there is
  no frame there; closing that means the nested form opens its own scope.
- **`?`.** With expression semantics the answer is uniform: `?t` prints the
  expression, like any other name.
- **Whether it earns its place.** The parameter-capture case genuinely cannot
  be written as two lines: the second line would be a global that cannot see
  `x`. That is the argument the transcripts have to make.

---

## Deferred

Recorded so they are not re-litigated later, or drifted into by accident.

- **Substitution and partial expansion.** `?b` showing `2+2` rather than
  `a+a`: evaluating some references while leaving others symbolic. This is a
  different feature from printing a definition back, not an option on it. It
  needs its own syntax, a rule for how far expansion goes, and an answer for
  what a partially evaluated sequence or matrix of expressions even means.
  `?name` (phase 4, item 6) prints what was written and nothing more.

- **A third-party matrix library.** Raised explicitly, as `CLAUDE.md` §5
  requires, and declined for now. Measured against what the code actually is:
  `matrix.hpp` is 190 lines, of which roughly eighty are the arithmetic a
  library would replace, and they are now unit-tested. Eigen, the obvious
  candidate, is a megabyte of headers.

  The semantics do not line up either, in three ways that would each need
  adapter code: `/` here is element-wise, not scalar division; a 1x1 matrix
  is deliberately also the scalar type, which D9 measured and chose to keep,
  where a library makes that a type distinction; and the block expansion that
  sizes `[a, a; a, a]` from what its cells evaluate to is this language's own
  rule, living in the visitor rather than in `Matrix`.

  What decides it is that inkamath asks for nothing a library is good at. It
  has `+`, `-`, element-wise `/`, `*` and an integer power — no inverse, no
  determinant, no transpose, no solve. A library earns its place at the point
  those arrive, because pivoting and conditioning are genuinely hard and
  worth not writing. The seam is clean when that day comes: those operate on
  an evaluated numeric matrix, so the library sits *below* `Matrix`, on
  values, and never meets the expressions.

- **Symbolic simplification.** `x+x` to `2*x`, `x^1` to `x`, folding constant
  subtrees. The shape of the program invites it: names bind expressions, the
  AST survives evaluation, and `TransformationVisitor`'s own 2014 comment
  lists "simplify the tree" as one of the two things it exists for. D6's
  immutability helps rather than hinders — a simplifier builds a new tree
  rather than editing one — and `?` would give the result somewhere to show.

  What stops it being small is specific to *this* language rather than to
  simplification generally: **the identities are unsound over matrices.**
  `x*0` is not `0` when `x` is a matrix, because the result's extent comes
  from `x`; nor is `x-x`, for the same reason. Almost every algebraic rule
  needs the extent of its operands, and an extent is only known after
  evaluating them — which is the thing simplification is meant to avoid. The
  complex arithmetic adds the usual IEEE caveats: `x-x` is not `0` at NaN,
  and `(x^2)^0.5` is not `x` off the positive reals.

  So the sound subset is roughly constant folding over literals, which buys
  little, and everything beyond it needs a type-and-extent analysis the
  interpreter does not have. A real CAS is a larger program than this
  interpreter, and the size constraint at the top of this file is the reason
  to say so out loud rather than drift towards one. Recorded, not scheduled:
  if it is ever wanted, it starts with extents, not with rewrite rules.

## Sequencing

Phase 2 gated everything: no implementation work started before the
transcripts said what it should do. Phase 3 came next because C13 made every
later change observable, then phase 4, the redesign the rest of the plan
exists to serve, then phase 5 and phase 6.

Phase 7 is the second pass's queue. Its order is the reverse of the first
plan's: there, the argument was that nothing could be seen until failure
existed, so C13 came first. Here the interpreter reports failure well and
crashes anyway, so the crashes go first. C22 and C23 come next not because
they are subtle but because they are not — the headline feature is broken at
three columns, and a corpus that never exceeded 2x2 is why nobody noticed.

Phase 8 waits for phase 7. It is the only phase that changes the language
rather than repairing it, and it was worth nothing while four inputs still
killed the process.

The honest risk was phase 4. It changed what existing sessions mean, so it
could not hide behind unchanged goldens — every moved line was justified
against a spec transcript, in the commit that moved it.
